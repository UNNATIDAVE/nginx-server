# Deployment using Nginx

## Problem statement -

    a) Install Nginx on your computer and run it.
    b) Host the assignment completed in previous level on your localhost using Nginx.
    c) Create Error pages - 404 (Not Found) and 500(internal server error) and point to
       these error pages in your Nginx configuration file. The configuration file should
       make sure that when the route 404 or 500 is called, the nginx web server is
       serving the page you created rather than its default page.
    d) Create a GIT repository and push your Nginx configuration file in that repository.
       Your mentor will check that configuration file to make sure that application is
       deployed correctly on your end.
